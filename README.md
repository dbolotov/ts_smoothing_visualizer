# Time Series Smoothing Visualizer

An interactive Streamlit app for exploring time series smoothing methods across a variety of datasets. 

The app was built to demonstrate different smoothing techniques and how they affect noisy time series data.

The methods visualized are: Moving Average, Estimated Moving Average, Savitzky-Golay, LOESS, Gaussian filter, and Kalman filter.

This directory also includes a notebook with some initial plotting and exploration of the noisy sine dataset.
