# Time Series Smoothing: an Interactive Visualizer

<a href="https://timeseriessmoothing.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">â–¶ Try the App</a>

This repository contains the code for a Streamlit app that visualizes time series smoothing techniques. It includes both real and synthetic datasets and lets you compare how different methods behave with adjustable parameters.

**Features**
- Adjustable smoothing parameters
- Visual comparison across methods
- 5 datasets

**Supported methods**
- Moving Average
- Exponential Moving Average
- Savitzky-Golay
- LOESS
- Gaussian Filter
- Kalman Filter
