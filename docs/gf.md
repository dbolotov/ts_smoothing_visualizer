[Gaussian Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter): Applies a weighted average where weights follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Good for reducing noise while still preserving the overall shape of the signal.  

**Limitations:** Smoothing can blur sharp transitions.

**Parameters:**
- `Sigma`: Standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel, which controls the smoothing amount.
