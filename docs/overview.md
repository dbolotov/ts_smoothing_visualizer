This app demonstrates six smoothing techniques commonly used in time series analysis. Each method balances noise reduction and signal preservation in a different way.

Use the controls to select a dataset, adjust parameters, and compare how each method smooths a noisy signal in real time.

**Usage**
- Choose from several preloaded datasets (e.g., Sunspots, Weather, Synthetic)
- Enable or disable specific smoothing methods
- Adjust each methodâ€™s parameters to see their effect on the signal
- Compare curves visually and review roughness metrics in the diagnostics table
